                <p>
                    Government spending refers to money spent by the public
                    sector on the acquisition of goods and provision of services
                    such as education, healthcare, social protection, and
                    defense. In national income accounting, when the government
                    acquires goods and services for current use to directly
                    satisfy the individual or collective needs and requirements
                    of the community, it is classified as government final
                    consumption spending. When the government acquires goods and
                    services for future use, it is classified as government
                    investment. This includes public consumption and public
                    investment, and transfer payments consisting of income
                    transfers.

                    <p>
                        Military expenditure, also known as a defense budget, is
                        the amount of financial resources dedicated by a state
                        to raising and maintaining an armed forces or other
                        methods essential for defense purposes. Military budgets
                        often reflect how strongly a country perceives the
                        likelihood of threats against it, or the amount of
                        aggression it wishes to conjure. It also gives an idea
                        of how much financing should be provided for the
                        upcoming fiscal year.

                <p>
                    A country's gross government debt (also called public debt,
                    or sovereign debt) is the financial liabilities of the
                    government sector. Changes in government debt over time
                    reflect primarily borrowing due to past government deficits.
                    A deficit occurs when a government's expenditures exceed
                    revenues. Government debt may be owed to domestic residents,
                    as well as to foreign residents. If owed to foreign
                    residents, that quantity is included in the country's
                    external debt.

                        Taxes are mandatory contributions levied on individuals
                        or corporations by a government entity—whether local,
                        regional, or national. Tax revenues finance government
                        activities, including public works and services such as
                        roads and schools, or programs such as Social Security
                        and Medicare. Taxes are mandatory contributions
                        collected by governments.

                    <p>
                        Tax revenue is the income that is collected by
                        governments through taxation. Taxation is the primary
                        source of government revenue. Revenue may be extracted
                        from sources such as individuals, public enterprises,
                        trade, royalties on natural resources and/or foreign
                        aid.

                        A corporate tax is a tax on the profits of a
                        corporation. The taxes are paid on a company's taxable
                        income, which includes revenue minus cost of goods sold
                        (COGS), general and administrative (G&A) expenses,
                        selling and marketing, research and development,
                        depreciation, and other operating costs.
