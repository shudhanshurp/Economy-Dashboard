            <h1 class="main-title">Expenditure</h1>
            <p>Government spending refers to money spent by the public sector on the acquisition of goods and provision
                of
                services such as education, healthcare, social protection, and defense. In national income accounting,
                when the
                government acquires goods and services for current use to directly satisfy the individual or collective
                needs
                and requirements of the community, it is classified as government final consumption spending. When the
                government acquires goods and services for future use, it is classified as government investment. This
                includes
                public consumption and public investment, and transfer payments consisting of income transfers.</p>

                <p>Military expenditure, also known as a defense budget, is the amount of financial resources dedicated

                    state to raising and maintaining an armed forces or other methods essential for defense purposes.
                    Military
                    budgets often reflect how strongly a country perceives the likelihood of threats against it, or the
                    amount of
                    aggression it wishes to conjure. It also gives an idea of how much financing should be provided for
                    the

            <p>A country's gross government debt (also called public debt, or sovereign debt) is the financial
                liabilities of
                the government sector. Changes in government debt over time reflect primarily borrowing due to past
                government
                deficits. A deficit occurs when a government's expenditures exceed revenues. Government debt may be owed
                to
                domestic residents, as well as to foreign residents. If owed to foreign residents, that quantity is
                included in
                the country's external debt.</p>
